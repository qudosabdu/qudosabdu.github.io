# Welcome to My Website!

## About Me

Hello! I’m Abdul Qudoos, a passionate and results-driven Full Stack Developer with a degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Dawood University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi. I specialize in building modern, responsive, and scalable web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with a strong focus on frontend development.

I have hands-on experience working with React.js, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design, and integrating 3D visuals using Three.js to enhance user interaction. On the backend, I build scalable RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js, manage data with MongoDB, and implement features like authentication, role-based access control, and file uploads.

I’m deeply committed to learning and innovation, and I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions.

## Short Introduction

Previously, I completed a Frontend Development Internship at TekRevol, where I contributed to enterprise-grade frontend applications using React.js, SCSS, and Ant Design, and collaborated in Agile sprints to deliver production-ready features.

I also worked as a freelance Full Stack Developer, where I independently developed a complete Learning Management System (LMS), integrating features like user roles, class/section management, assignments, and student performance tracking.

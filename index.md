## About Me

Hello, I'm Abdul Qudoos, a highly motivated and ambitious Frontend Developer with a degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Dawood University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi, Pakistan. Recently graduated, I specialize in building responsive, user-friendly web applications using React.js, Ant Design, and Tailwind CSS. In addition to my frontend expertise, I have a strong foundation in backend development, including experience with Node.js and Express.js for building scalable server-side applications. I am passionate about full-stack development and thrive in dynamic environments where I can continue expanding my skills.

## Short Introduction

I am a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack developer with hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications. Currently, I am gaining practical industry exposure as a Frontend Developer Intern at [TekRevol](https://www.tekrevol.com/) where I work on creating responsive and dynamic web solutions while continuing to develop my backend skills.

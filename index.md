## About Me

Hello! I'm **Abdul Qudoos**, a passionate and results-driven **Full Stack Developer** with a degree in **Computer Systems Engineering** from Dawood University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi. I specialize in building modern, responsive, and scalable web applications using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), with a strong focus on **frontend development**.

I have hands-on experience working with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Ant Design**, and integrating **3D visuals using Three.js** to enhance user interaction. On the backend, I build scalable RESTful APIs using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, manage data with **MongoDB**, and implement features like **authentication**, **role-based access control**, and **file uploads**.

I'm deeply committed to learning and innovation, and I enjoy turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions.

## Short Introduction

I’m currently working as a **MERN Stack Developer at [InfinityXDynamics](https://www.infinityxdynamics.com/)**, where I build and maintain full-stack applications involving **interactive UIs**, **3D modeling**, and robust **backend architecture**.

Previously, I completed a **Frontend Development Internship at [TekRevol](https://www.tekrevol.com/)**, where I contributed to enterprise-grade frontend applications using **React.js**, **SCSS**, and **Ant Design**, and collaborated in Agile sprints to deliver production-ready features.

I also worked as a freelance **Full Stack Developer**, where I independently developed a complete **Learning Management System (LMS)**, integrating features like user roles, class/section management, assignments, and student performance tracking.
